This project aims to analyze an employee dataset to uncover insights and patterns that can help improve human resources decision-making. By performing EDA, we can understand the dataset's structure, detect anomalies, identify trends, and visualize key metrics.

Objectives:
Clean and preprocess the employee data to ensure its quality.
Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into employee demographics, performance, and retention.
Visualize findings using various Python libraries.
